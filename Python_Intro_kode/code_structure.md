**Follow the PEP8 standards**

Structuring and naming your code effectively in Python can make it more readable, maintainable, and Pythonic. Here are some key guidelines:

1. Follow the PEP 8 Style Guide

PEP 8 is the official style guide for Python. Following these guidelines will help keep your code consistent with the wider Python community.

2. File and Folder Structure

Organize your files and folders to separate different concerns:

	•	Main Program: Typically named main.py or app.py.
	•	Modules/Packages: If your code has several modules, create separate Python files or folders. For example, for a project named my_project, you might structure it as:

my_project/
├── main.py
├── utils.py              # Utility functions
├── data/
│   └── data_processing.py # Data-related code
├── models/
│   └── model.py           # Model code
├── tests/
│   └── test_model.py      # Tests for the model
└── README.md              # Project description



3. Naming Conventions

Consistent naming makes your code more understandable. Here are some common Python naming styles:

	•	Variables and Function Names: Use snake_case (e.g., my_variable, process_data()).
	•	Class Names: Use CamelCase (e.g., DataProcessor, UserAccount).
	•	Constants: Use ALL_CAPS for constants (e.g., MAX_RETRIES, PI).
	•	Private Methods or Variables: Prefix with an underscore (e.g., _helper_function() or _internal_variable).

4. Function and Variable Naming Tips

	•	Be Descriptive: Name functions and variables clearly to describe their purpose. For instance, use calculate_total_price() instead of calc_price().
	•	Avoid Single-Letter Names: Use full words instead, except in cases like loop counters (i, j, k).
	•	Boolean Names: For Boolean variables, use names that indicate true/false, such as is_active, has_permission.

5. Docstrings and Comments

	•	Function Docstrings: Use docstrings to describe what each function or class does. Place them immediately after the function header.

def calculate_total_price(price, tax):
    """Calculate the total price after adding tax."""
    return price + (price * tax)


	•	Module and Class Docstrings: Describe the purpose and main functionality at the beginning of each file or class.
	•	Inline Comments: Use them sparingly to explain complex code, but avoid over-commenting straightforward code. If the code is complex, consider refactoring it instead.

6. Keep Functions Short and Single-Purpose

Follow the Single Responsibility Principle for functions and classes. Each function or class should do one thing well. If a function is too long or does multiple tasks, consider breaking it into smaller functions.

7. Organize Imports

	•	Import modules at the top of the file.
	•	Follow this order: standard library imports, third-party imports, and local application imports.
	•	Use specific imports instead of importing everything (e.g., from math import pi instead of from math import *).

8. Use Meaningful Module and Package Names

	•	Module names should be short and lowercase, without underscores (e.g., helpers.py, models.py).
	•	Package names should also be lowercase and preferably singular (e.g., data, models).

9. Leverage Type Hints (Python 3.5+)

Type hints can clarify expected argument and return types, enhancing readability and allowing better support from IDEs.

def calculate_total(price: float, tax: float) -> float:
    """Calculate total price after adding tax."""
    return price + (price * tax)

Following these guidelines will help keep your Python code organized, readable, and easy to maintain.
